Instructions for applying for the electronic travel authorization (ESTA) for the USA

Before entering the USA, all travelers must obtain an electronic travel authorization (ESTA).  
The ESTA currently costs $21 (as of February 2024) (approx. EUR 20.00) and is available on the official website: https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/ directly from the CBP (border authority).  
Payment is made by credit card or PayPal.

We recommend submitting the application as early as possible, but no later than 72 hours before departure for the USA, and not using any other VISA provider to ensure that the application and approval process run smoothly.

Please check in advance whether your passport is still valid for at least 6 months after your return from the USA.  
If you have an existing and valid ESTA travel authorization, you do not need to apply for a new one.

You will need the following documents for the application:
- Passport and identity card
- Credit card or PayPal access data
- Contact details of your emergency contact and your employer

After receiving your ESTA authorization, please print it out and keep it in your hand luggage together with your passport for entry and for your return trip for the border authorities.

If you have been in Cuba with your current passport on or after January 12, 2021, please contact us by phone at +49 791 49 380 162 or by e-mail at clubreisen@marbet.com.

Waiver

The Electronic Travel Authorization System performs checks against police databases.  
Travelers under the Visa Waiver Program must obtain an electronic travel authorization before boarding.

An approved application confirms you may travel but does not guarantee entry into the United States.  
At the port of entry, a Customs and Border Protection officer will inspect and may deny entry under U.S. laws.

The decision that you are not eligible for ESTA does not prevent you from applying for a visa.

All information provided must be true and accurate.  
Authorizations can be revoked anytime based on new information.  
Knowingly submitting false, fictitious, or fraudulent information can result in revocation and criminal penalties.

---

WARNING

If cleared for entry under the Visa Waiver Program, you are not permitted to:
- Accept unauthorized employment,
- Attend school,
- Represent foreign media.

You are prohibited from applying for:
1. A change to nonimmigrant status,
2. An extension of stay,
3. Adjustment of status to temporary or permanent residence (unless qualifying under Section 205(c)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).

Violations will result in serious consequences.

Please confirm that you have read and understood this warning.

TRAVEL PROMOTION ACT OF 2009

In March 2010, President Obama signed the Travel Promotion Act (TPA), directing DHS to establish a fee for ESTA usage.  
The fee is $21 (as of 2024), including $17 for authorization and $4 for processing.

Applicants denied authorization will only pay $4.

Payment must be made by credit card or PayPal.

Entering incorrect information may cause additional fees for reapplication.  
Stopping payment or incomplete payment results in ESTA revocation.

By submitting the application, you agree to all fees and understand there will be no refunds.
